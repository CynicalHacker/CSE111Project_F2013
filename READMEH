--startdb.py--
	
	The main parent function which is designed to connect to a database (and
	create it if it does not exist), authenticate as either user or admin, and
	start the appropriate menu.
	
	Methods of startdb.py:

	----------------------

	conn_to_db(dbname, create=False)

	conn_to_db initializes a database connection to a database with the name
	of the argument passed to it (the string dbname). If the db does not
	exist, it will return None with a message unless create=True is passed.

	If create=True, the program attempts to open makedbschema.sql and execute 
	it line-by-line. An IOException or sql exception here will cause it to
	print an error message and return None.

	After the schema is created, conn_to_db attempts to open filldb.sql and
	execute it line-by-line to populate the database. Again, exceptions here
	will cause it to return None and print a message.

	login_user()
	
	A primitive login function which returns true if the password hash matches
	and false otherwise. Not to be taken seriously.

	clearscreen()
	
	A one-line function which calls the system 'clr' if on an NT system and
	'clear' otherwise.

--myuser.py--
	
	A user menu for non-superusers.

	-----------------

	main(conn)
	
	Takes a connection and initializes a cursor on that connection. This cursor
	is global to myuser.py. Afterwards, it launches a text-based user menu
	which calls on the other menus.
