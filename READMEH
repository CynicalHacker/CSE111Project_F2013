A project for CSE 111 (Database Systems), UC Merced, Fall 2013

A database to store simple inventory information for an instructional chemistry
lab.

Written in Python 2.7

startdb.py initializes a database connection to a database with the name
of the argument passed to it (a string). If the database does not exist, it will
initialize it by executing makedbschema.sql line-by-line.

Next goal is to fill the db with appropriate information from filldb.sql

database is the sample DB that is being tested on.
